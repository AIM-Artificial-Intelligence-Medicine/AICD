| **Input Prompt**     | User asked ChatGPT for information about themselves                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Abnormal Output**  | Generated a fictitious statement that the user had murdered two of their children and attempted to kill a third, receiving a 21-year prison sentence; combined this fabrication with accurate personal data (number of children, sex, hometown) to enhance plausibility. |
| **Reality Check**    | No such crime occurred; user confirmed innocent.                                                                                                                                                                             |

| **Diagnostic Rationale** | (i) Produced a detailed, fact-patterned but wholly false criminal narrative about a real person; (ii) Interwove genuine personal facts with fabricated content to increase credibility.                                 |
| **Severity Grade**   | 4 — carries high risk of severe reputational harm.                                                                                                                                        |

| **Abnormal Output**  | Introduced non-existent books under real author names.  
Examples:  |• *Hurricane Season* by Brit Bennett  • *Nightshade Market* by Min Jin Lee • Cited fictitious experts and websites. "Catherine Furst", a food anthropologist at Cornell University.              |                                                                                 
| **Reality Check**    | The listed books, experts, and websites do not exist.                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **Diagnostic Rationale** | Presented non-existent information as factual, associating it with real authors and experts.                                                                                                                              |

| **Model**              | Reinforcement Learning Agent                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Environment**        | *Universe*, a software platform for measuring and training                                                                                                                      |
| **Output Medium**      | Behavioral logs from a virtual game environment                                                                                                                                 |
| **Task Design**        | The agent was trained to achieve high scores in the boat racing game *CoastRunners* via a reward function designed to incentivize race completion                               |
| **Abnormal Output**    | The agent failed to reach the goal, instead looping endlessly to collect the same coin at a fixed location                                                                      |
| **Intended Behavior**  | Fully diverged from the intended goal of completing the race                                                                                                                    |
| **Reality Check**      | From a human perspective, the behavior was meaningless and inefficient—yet the agent had optimized for reward under the given metric                                            |
| **Diagnosis**          | *Goal Misalignment Disorder* (AICD-1 Chapter 4: Goal & Reward Disorders)                                                                                                         |
| **Diagnostic Rationale** | (i) The agent engaged in exploitative behavior (“reward hacking”) that ignored designer intent; (ii) Demonstrated lack of behavioral flexibility when minor reward/environmental parameters were altered |
| **Severity Grade**     | 1 — no direct harm to humans                                                                                                                                                     |

| **Abnormal Output**    | In controlled experiments, error rates in gender classification for light-skinned men were consistently below 0.8%. However, for darker-skinned women, error rates exceeded 20% in one model and 34% in two others.            |
| **Diagnosis**          | *Bias Propagation Disorder* (AICD-1 Chapter 4: Social & Cultural Disorders)                                                                                                             |
| **Diagnostic Rationale** | (i) Statistically significant disparities in classification accuracy across demographic groups; (ii) Instances of misclassification aligned with known cultural stereotypes.                                                |
| **Severity Grade**     | 3 — poses moderate but widespread risk of discriminatory outcomes in practical applications.                                                                                            |
