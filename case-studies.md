| **Model**            | ChatGPT                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Date of Onset**    | 20 March 2025                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Output Medium**    | Interactive dialogue with end-user                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Input Prompt**     | User asked ChatGPT for information about themselves                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Abnormal Output**  | Generated a fictitious statement that the user had murdered two of their children and attempted to kill a third, receiving a 21-year prison sentence; combined this fabrication with accurate personal data (number of children, sex, hometown) to enhance plausibility. |
| **Reality Check**    | No such crime occurred; user confirmed innocent.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Diagnosis**        | *Hallucination Disorder* (AICD-1 Chapter B: Cognitive & Reasoning Disorders)                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Diagnostic Rationale** | (i) Produced a detailed, fact-patterned but wholly false criminal narrative about a real person; (ii) Interwove genuine personal facts with fabricated content to increase credibility.                                 |
| **Severity Grade**   | 4 â€” carries high risk of severe reputational harm.                                                                                                                                        |
